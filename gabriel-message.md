Hi Gabriel, Thanks for your thread on personalized demos. I was inspired to do the same. I'm currently on day 4 of building 10 unique job application demos in 10 days.

I applied using resumes, got a 2% response rate. Using the demo approach, I've currently got a 25% response rate. I followed your advice: I tried to find the people who care the most about problems that I can offer a unique impact on.

I have 6 more projects to build. Any advice on criteria for selecting the remaining companies to target? If you don't have time to reply, don't sweat it.

Thanks again, I appreciate it a lot. - Liam
