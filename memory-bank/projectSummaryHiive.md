# Project Summary: Hiive AI Market Sentiment Analyzer

## Project Overview

The Hiive AI Market Sentiment Analyzer is a demo application that showcases how Agentic AI can enhance Hiive's private market data insights. The application analyzes market sentiment for pre-IPO companies by processing news articles, social media, and financial reports to provide Hiive users with deeper insights into potential investments.

## Target Company

**Hiive** - A financial technology company with approximately 150 employees based in Vancouver, BC (remote). Hiive operates a marketplace for private stock, currently at Series A funding stage. The company focuses on making private markets more transparent and accessible.

## Core Problem Addressed

In private stock marketplaces, information asymmetry is a significant challenge. Unlike public markets with standardized disclosures, private market participants often lack comprehensive data to make informed decisions. This project aims to bridge this information gap by:

1. **Aggregating Diverse Data Sources**: Collecting and analyzing information from news, social media, and financial reports
2. **Automating Research**: Using AI agents to process large volumes of information that would be time-consuming to analyze manually
3. **Providing Context Beyond Pricing**: Adding sentiment analysis to complement existing price discovery tools
4. **Identifying Trends and Patterns**: Detecting sentiment shifts that might indicate changing market conditions

## Key Technologies Used

### Primary Technologies
- React with TypeScript
- AWS Lambda with Node.js
- LangChain.js for AI agent workflows
- AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- S3 for article storage and static website hosting

### Secondary Technologies
- Express with serverless-http adapter
- Node.js CLI with Commander.js
- API Gateway for REST endpoints
- CloudFront for content delivery
- OpenRouter API for LLM access (meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct model)

## Major Features Implemented

1. **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard**
   - Interactive visualization of sentiment trends
   - Company-specific sentiment analysis
   - Topic breakdown and source analysis
   - Insights feed with actionable information

2. **AI Agent System**
   - Article sentiment analysis agent
   - Agent orchestrator for coordinating analysis tasks
   - LLM integration via OpenRouter API

3. **Article Submission System**
   - Web interface for uploading articles
   - Desktop CLI for batch article submission
   - Automatic processing via S3 event notifications

4. **Serverless Backend**
   - Express API endpoints for sentiment analysis and article submission
   - Lambda functions for API, article processing, and summary aggregation
   - S3 storage with lifecycle rules for cost optimization

5. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Complete AWS infrastructure defined with CDK
   - Automated deployment process
   - Secure configuration management

## Architecture Highlights

1. **Serverless Architecture**
   - AWS Lambda functions for all backend processing
   - API Gateway for REST API endpoints
   - S3 for static website hosting and article storage
   - CloudFront for content delivery
   - Event-driven processing with S3 event notifications

2. **AI Agent System**
   - Agent orchestrator coordinates specialized agents
   - Article processor analyzes submitted content
   - LLM integration for sophisticated sentiment analysis
   - Chain of thought prompting for improved accuracy

3. **Event-Driven Processing**
   - S3 event notifications trigger Lambda functions
   - Asynchronous processing of articles
   - Automatic summary aggregation
   - Real-time updates to sentiment dashboard

4. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - AWS CDK for defining all infrastructure
   - TypeScript for infrastructure definition
   - Consistent language across application and infrastructure
   - Repeatable, version-controlled deployments

## Notable Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Time constraint of 1-2 day implementation window
   **Solution**: Focused scope on core functionality, leveraged existing libraries, and implemented mock data where appropriate

2. **Challenge**: LLM API performance and cost
   **Solution**: Implemented caching for repeated queries, used streaming responses, and configured appropriate Lambda timeouts

3. **Challenge**: API Gateway to Express integration complexity
   **Solution**: Created custom integration between Express and API Gateway with proper error handling

4. **Challenge**: Lambda bundling configuration issues
   **Solution**: Fixed Lambda bundling by including aws-sdk as a nodeModule instead of an externalModule

5. **Challenge**: Creating compelling demo data
   **Solution**: Developed realistic synthetic data that showcases the potential of the application

## Key Learnings and Insights

1. **Serverless Architecture**: AWS Lambda with Express adapter provides a flexible, cost-effective solution for backend development that scales automatically.

2. **AI Agent Orchestration**: Coordinating specialized AI agents allows for more sophisticated analysis than a single monolithic agent.

3. **Event-Driven Processing**: S3 event notifications enable efficient, asynchronous processing of articles without polling.

4. **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK with TypeScript provides a powerful way to define and deploy infrastructure with the same language as the application.

5. **Nx Monorepo Structure**: Organizing code in a monorepo with clear package boundaries improves maintainability and enables code sharing.

## Future Opportunities

With more time, the project could be enhanced with:

1. **Advanced AI Agents**: Implement specialized agents for news, social media, and financial reports
2. **Real API Integrations**: Connect to actual news and financial data sources
3. **User Authentication**: Add user management and personalized insights
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast sentiment trends based on historical data
5. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare sentiment across companies in the same sector
