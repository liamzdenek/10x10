## Known Issues

### Project Scope
1. **Issue**: Defining realistic scope for 1-day projects
   **Impact**: May lead to incomplete projects or quality compromises
   **Plan**: Establish clear minimum viable product definitions for each project

### Integration Complexity
1. **Issue**: Integrating diverse projects with different technologies
   **Impact**: May create technical challenges for portfolio implementation
   **Plan**: Design flexible integration approach with standardized metadata

### Documentation Consistency
1. **Issue**: Maintaining consistent documentation across all projects
   **Impact**: May result in varying quality of project presentations
   **Plan**: Create documentation templates and standards for all projects

### Time Management
1. **Issue**: Completing 10 projects in 10 days is ambitious
   **Impact**: May lead to burnout or quality issues in later projects
   **Plan**: Implement progressive planning and reuse patterns where appropriate
