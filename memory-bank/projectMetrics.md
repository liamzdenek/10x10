## Comparative Metrics

These metrics will be calculated across projects to identify patterns and insights:

- **Efficiency Ratio**: Hours spent per feature implemented
- **Cost Efficiency**: Total cost per feature implemented
- **Technology Diversity**: Number of unique technologies used across all projects
- **Complexity Trend**: How project complexity changes over the 10-day period
- **Learning Curve**: Rate of improvement in implementing similar features
- **Response Rate**: Percentage of applications that received responses
- **Interview Conversion Rate**: Percentage of applications that led to interviews

## Visualization Metrics

These metrics will be used specifically for portfolio visualizations:

- **Technology Distribution**: Visualization of technologies used across projects
- **Time Allocation**: Breakdown of how time was spent across different activities
- **Complexity Radar**: Radar chart showing different complexity dimensions
- **Cost Breakdown**: Visualization of where resources were allocated
- **Learning Progression**: Visualization of skill development over the 10 projects
- **Outcome Comparison**: Visualization of application outcomes

## Project Tagging

Each project will also be tagged with the following categorical information:

- **Project Type**: e.g., Web Application, API, Data Analysis, Mobile App, etc.
- **Primary Focus**: e.g., Frontend, Backend, Full Stack, Data, DevOps, etc.
- **Business Value**: e.g., Customer Acquisition, Operational Efficiency, Analytics, etc.
