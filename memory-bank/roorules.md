# Project Intelligence: 10x10 Job Application Portfolio

## Critical Implementation Paths

1. **Memory Bank Architecture**
   - Each project has its own memory bank with standard files
   - Portfolio memory bank references project memory banks via symbolic links
   - Memory bank updates should be performed after significant changes
   - Documentation should be comprehensive enough to understand the project without seeing the code

2. **Project Integration Flow**
   - Projects remain independent with their own repositories
   - Portfolio extracts metadata and insights from project memory banks
   - Standardized metadata schema enables consistent presentation
   - Cross-project analysis identifies patterns and learnings

3. **Portfolio Development Workflow**
   - Portfolio website is developed incrementally
   - Components are designed for reusability across project showcases
   - Content is generated from memory banks where possible
   - Manual content is minimized to ensure consistency

4. **Project Development Cycle**
   - Each project follows a consistent development cycle:
     1. Research company and identify relevant problem
     2. Define project scope and requirements
     3. Implement core functionality within 1-day timeframe
     4. Document comprehensively in memory bank
     5. Integrate with portfolio
   - Learnings from each project inform subsequent projects

## User Preferences and Workflow

1. **Documentation Approach**
   - Prefer markdown for all documentation
   - Use mermaid diagrams for visual representation of architecture
   - Include code snippets with syntax highlighting for key concepts
   - Document both technical implementation and business context

2. **Project Organization**
   - Maintain clear separation between projects
   - Use consistent naming conventions across projects
   - Organize code with clear folder structures
   - Implement comprehensive READMEs for each project

3. **Development Environment**
   - Use VS Code as primary development environment
   - Leverage GitHub for version control
   - Implement consistent linting and formatting across projects
   - Use environment variables for configuration

4. **Portfolio Navigation**
   - Prioritize intuitive navigation between projects
   - Enable filtering by technology, company, or problem domain
   - Provide both overview and detailed views of projects
   - Ensure responsive design for all devices

## Project-Specific Patterns

1. **Memory Bank Pattern**
   - projectbrief.md: Core requirements and goals
   - productContext.md: Business context and value proposition
   - systemPatterns.md: Architecture and design patterns
   - techContext.md: Technology stack and implementation details
   - activeContext.md: Current focus and recent changes
   - progress.md: Status tracking and milestone planning
   - roorules.md: Project-specific patterns and preferences

2. **Project Metadata Pattern**
   - Each project includes standardized metadata:
     - Title and description
     - Target company and role
     - Technologies used (categorized)
     - Key challenges addressed
     - Implementation timeframe
     - Primary learnings
     - Links to source code and demo

3. **Integration Pattern**
   - Remote memory banks are linked to portfolio
   - Metadata is extracted and transformed
   - Project showcases follow consistent template
   - Cross-project insights are aggregated

4. **Learning Documentation Pattern**
   - Technical learnings are captured in context
   - Process improvements are documented
   - Challenges and solutions are detailed
   - Cross-project patterns are identified

## Known Challenges

1. **Project Scope Management**
   - One-day timeframe requires careful scope definition
   - Focus on core functionality over polish
   - Prioritize demonstration of key skills
   - Document what would be done with more time

2. **Technology Diversity**
   - Different projects may use different tech stacks
   - Portfolio must handle diverse integration needs
   - Consistent presentation despite technical differences
   - Balancing depth vs. breadth of technology usage

3. **Documentation Consistency**
   - Maintaining consistent quality across all projects
   - Ensuring comprehensive coverage of all aspects
   - Balancing technical detail with readability
   - Managing documentation time vs. development time

4. **Portfolio Performance**
   - Handling multiple project integrations efficiently
   - Optimizing asset loading for performance
   - Managing memory usage with extensive content
   - Ensuring responsive experience across devices

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Project Selection Criteria**
   - Initially focused on demonstrating technical diversity
   - Evolved to prioritize solving relevant business problems
   - Now emphasizing both technical skill and business understanding
   - Future projects will be selected based on target company needs

2. **Documentation Approach**
   - Started with basic documentation requirements
   - Expanded to comprehensive memory bank structure
   - Implemented cross-project referencing
   - Planning to enhance with automated insight extraction

3. **Portfolio Architecture**
   - Initially conceived as simple project showcase
   - Evolved to include cross-project analysis
   - Now implementing standardized metadata and integration
   - Planning to enhance with interactive exploration features

4. **Development Timeline**
   - Originally planned sequential project development
   - Adjusted to include portfolio development in parallel
   - Now implementing incremental approach with regular integration
   - Planning to optimize workflow based on early project experiences

## Tool Usage Patterns

1. **Memory Bank Management**
   ```bash
   # Update memory bank after significant changes
   # Review all files for consistency
   # Ensure cross-references are maintained
   ```

2. **Project Integration**
   ```bash
   # Link project memory bank to portfolio
   ln -s /path/to/project/memory-bank /path/to/portfolio/remote-memory-banks/project-name
   
   # Extract project metadata
   node scripts/extract-metadata.js --project=project-name
   
   # Update portfolio with new project
   npm run update-portfolio
   ```

3. **Portfolio Development**
   ```bash
   # Start development server
   npm run dev
   
   # Build for production
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

4. **Project Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Generate cross-project insights
   node scripts/analyze-projects.js
   
   # Update technology usage visualization
   node scripts/update-tech-chart.js
   
   # Generate learning summary
   node scripts/extract-learnings.js
   ```
