# Project Completion Procedure

This document outlines the standardized procedure to follow when a new project is completed and added to the 10x10 Job Application Portfolio. This procedure ensures consistent documentation and data collection across all projects.

## Trigger

The procedure is initiated when the user states: **"I've finished a project"** and provides information about the new remote memory bank.

## Procedure Steps

### 1. Remote Memory Bank Verification

- Confirm the location of the new remote memory bank
- Verify that the memory bank contains all required core files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md
  - progress.md
  - roorules.md
- If any files are missing, request that they be created before proceeding

### 2. Project Metrics Collection

- Extract available metrics from the project's memory bank files
- For each metric defined in projectMetrics.md:
  - Check if the information is available in the memory bank
  - If not available, explicitly ask for the missing information
  - Record all metrics in a standardized format

### 3. Project Summary Creation

- Create a concise project summary based on the collected information
- Include:
  - Project name and target company
  - Core problem addressed
  - Key technologies used
  - Major features implemented
  - Notable challenges and solutions
  - Key learnings and insights

### 4. Portfolio Integration

- Add the project to the portfolio tracking system
- Update cross-project metrics and comparisons
- Identify and document patterns and insights across projects
- Update the portfolio progress tracking

### 5. Retrospective Questions

Ask the following retrospective questions to capture qualitative insights:

1. What went well with this project?
2. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
3. What would you do differently if you had more time?
4. What key learnings will you apply to future projects?
5. How did this project differ from previous ones in the series?

### 6. Metrics Verification

- Ensure all required metrics have been collected
- For any new metrics added since previous projects:
  - Retroactively collect this information for all previous projects
  - Update the metrics documentation accordingly
- Verify consistency of metric formats across all projects

### 7. Documentation Update

- Update the portfolio's memory bank files:
  - Update progress.md with new completion status
  - Update activeContext.md with recent changes
  - Update any patterns or learnings in roorules.md
  - Add new insights to cross-project analysis

### 8. Next Project Preparation

- Identify potential improvements for the next project based on learnings
- Update project tracking to reflect completion
- Prepare for the next project in the sequence

## Required Project Metrics

The following metrics must be collected for each project:

### Project Overview
- Project Summary
- Project Value Proposition

### Basic Information
- Company Name
- Company Size
- Industry
- Location
- Title Sought
- Sent to Who (titles only)
- Stated Base Salary
- Estimated Total Comp

### Resource Metrics
- Hours Spent (total)
- LLM Dollars Spent
- Hosting Dollars Spent

### Technical Details
- Primary Technologies
- Secondary Technologies
- Project Type
- Primary Focus
- Lines of Code
- Deployment Mechanism

### Learning Metrics
- New Technologies Learned
- Skills Improved
- Key Challenges

### Application Impact
- Response Received (if applicable)
- Response Time (if applicable)
- Response Type (if applicable)
- Feedback Received (if applicable)
- Interview Conversion (if applicable)

## Consistency Enforcement

If a new metric is added to the tracking system:

1. Document the new metric in projectMetrics.md
2. Collect the new metric for the current project
3. Retroactively collect the metric for all previous projects
4. Update all project metric records to include the new information
5. Ensure consistent formatting and measurement across all projects

This procedure ensures that the portfolio maintains complete and consistent information across all projects, enabling meaningful cross-project analysis and insights.
