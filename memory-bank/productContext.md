# Product Context: 10x10 Job Application Portfolio

## Why This Project Exists

In the competitive landscape of tech job hunting, traditional resumes and cover letters often fail to effectively showcase a candidate's true capabilities. The 10x10 Job Application Portfolio addresses this challenge by creating a comprehensive demonstration of skills, problem-solving approaches, and domain knowledge through 10 unique projects completed over 10 days.

This portfolio serves multiple purposes:
1. Provides concrete examples of work that go beyond resume bullet points
2. Demonstrates initiative, creativity, and dedication to potential employers
3. Shows adaptability across different technologies, domains, and requirements
4. Creates a narrative of professional growth and learning throughout the process

## Problems It Solves

- **Domain Knowledge**: Challenge in demonstrating understanding of specific industries or company needs

### For Employers
- **Evaluation Difficulty**: Traditional hiring processes often fail to accurately assess a candidate's actual capabilities
