## Key Patterns and Trends

### Technology Patterns
- React with TypeScript is the dominant frontend technology (6/7 projects)
- AWS serverless architecture is a consistent pattern (5/7 projects)
- Infrastructure as Code with AWS CDK is used in 5/7 projects
- Event-driven architecture is becoming more common in later projects (2/7 projects)
- CSS Modules for styling is emerging as a pattern (1/7 projects)

### Communication Patterns
- Executive communication style (direct, clear, focused on value) emerging as effective
- Demo-first approach before technical explanations
- Balancing technical depth with business value alignment
- Increasing focus on domain-specific knowledge demonstration

### Learning Progression
- Increasing complexity in architecture from project to project
- Growing comfort with AWS services and serverless architecture
- Evolution from single-language to multi-language implementations
- Improved ability to align technical solutions with business priorities
- Increasing sophistication in database design (from simple tables to single-table design)

## Future Opportunities
- Explore different technology stacks beyond React/AWS
- Consider mobile or desktop application development
- Implement more sophisticated AI/ML capabilities
- Develop projects with different architectural patterns
- Explore more complex database designs and access patterns
