## Key Patterns and Trends

### Technology Patterns
- React with TypeScript is the dominant frontend technology (5/5 projects)
- AWS serverless architecture is a consistent pattern (4/5 projects)
- Infrastructure as Code with AWS CDK is used in 4/5 projects
- Event-driven architecture is becoming more common in later projects

### Communication Patterns
- Executive communication style (direct, clear, focused on value) emerging as effective
- Demo-first approach before technical explanations
- Balancing technical depth with business value alignment

### Learning Progression
- Increasing complexity in architecture from project to project
- Growing comfort with AWS services and serverless architecture
- Evolution from single-language to multi-language implementations
- Improved ability to align technical solutions with business priorities

## Future Opportunities
- Explore different technology stacks beyond React/AWS
- Consider mobile or desktop application development
- Implement more sophisticated AI/ML capabilities
- Develop projects with different architectural patterns

This document will be updated as new projects are completed and as additional information becomes available for existing projects.
