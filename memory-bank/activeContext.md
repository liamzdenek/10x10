# Active Context: 10x10 Job Application Portfolio

## Current Work Focus

The 10x10 Job Application Portfolio project is in its initial planning and setup phase. The current focus is on:

1. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Setting up the documentation structure for the portfolio project
2. **Project Research**: Understanding the completed projects (Anima and Hiive applications)
3. **Portfolio Architecture**: Defining the structure and approach for the portfolio website
4. **Project Tracking**: Establishing a system to track details for each of the 10 projects
5. **Integration Strategy**: Determining how to integrate diverse projects into a cohesive portfolio
6. **Metrics Definition**: Defining standardized metrics to track across all projects
7. **Completion Procedure**: Establishing a consistent process for project completion

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Portfolio Website Implementation
- **Decision Needed**: Select the specific technology stack for the portfolio website
- **Options**:
  - Next.js with React for server-side rendering and static generation
  - Gatsby for static site generation with GraphQL data layer
  - Astro for content-focused static site generation
- **Current Direction**: Leaning toward Next.js for its flexibility, performance, and deployment options

### Project Metrics Collection
- **Decision Needed**: Determine the most efficient way to collect project metrics
- **Options**:
  - Manual entry after project completion
  - Semi-automated extraction from memory banks
  - Integrated tracking during project development
- **Current Direction**: Using a combination of memory bank extraction and manual collection through the project completion procedure

### Project Showcase Approach
- **Decision Needed**: Determine how to present projects in the portfolio
- **Options**:
  - Card-based grid layout with filtering
  - Timeline-based presentation showing the 10-day journey
  - Category-based grouping by technology or problem domain
- **Current Direction**: Considering a hybrid approach with multiple view options

### Metrics Visualization
- **Decision Needed**: Determine how to visualize project metrics and comparisons
- **Options**:
  - Interactive charts and graphs
  - Comparative tables with visual indicators
  - Radar/spider charts for multi-dimensional metrics
  - Timeline visualization showing progression
- **Current Direction**: Planning to use a combination of visualization types appropriate to each metric category

### Integration with Project Repositories
- **Decision Needed**: Establish how to link portfolio with project source code
- **Options**:
  - Direct links to GitHub repositories
  - Embedded code viewers for key files
  - Code snippet highlighting for important sections
- **Current Direction**: Planning to use a combination of repository links and embedded code snippets

## Open Questions

1. **Project Scope**: How comprehensive should each of the 10 projects be, given the 1-day timeframe per project?
2. **Portfolio Uniqueness**: How can the portfolio itself stand out as a demonstration of skills beyond the individual projects?
3. **Audience Focus**: Should the portfolio prioritize technical depth or business value demonstration?
4. **Project Selection**: What criteria should guide the selection of the remaining 8 companies/projects?
5. **Documentation Balance**: How to balance comprehensive documentation with development time for each project?
6. **Metrics Relevance**: Which metrics will be most valuable to potential employers?
7. **Completion Procedure Efficiency**: How can we streamline the project completion procedure while ensuring comprehensive data collection?
8. **Cross-Project Insights**: What types of insights across projects would be most valuable to highlight?

## Current Blockers

1. ✅ **Project Details**: Need to establish tracking system for project details
2. **Portfolio Design**: Need to finalize design approach for the portfolio website
3. **Time Management**: Need to establish realistic scope for each project given the 1-day constraint
4. ✅ **Integration Strategy**: Need to finalize approach for integrating diverse projects
5. ✅ **Documentation Standards**: Need to establish consistent documentation standards across projects
6. **Metrics Collection**: Need to collect complete metrics for existing projects
7. **Visualization Components**: Need to develop components for metrics visualization
