- **Emerging Pattern**: Focus on business value over technical complexity
- **Emerging Pattern**: Balancing ambitious scope with achievable implementation
- **Emerging Pattern**: Careful consideration of technology choices based on ROI

## Open Questions

1. **Project Scope**: How comprehensive should each of the 10 projects be, given the 1-day timeframe per project? The SoFi project pushed the boundaries of scope, demonstrating a lot but was barely achievable in a single day.
2. **Portfolio Uniqueness**: How can the portfolio itself stand out as a demonstration of skills beyond the individual projects?
3. **Audience Focus**: Should the portfolio prioritize technical depth or business value demonstration? The SoFi retrospective suggests focusing more on business value and demo-first approach.
4. **Project Selection**: What criteria should guide the selection of the remaining 5 companies/projects?
5. **Documentation Balance**: How to balance comprehensive documentation with development time for each project?
6. **Metrics Relevance**: Which metrics will be most valuable to potential employers?
7. **Completion Procedure Efficiency**: How can we streamline the project completion procedure while ensuring comprehensive data collection?
8. **Cross-Project Insights**: What types of insights across projects would be most valuable to highlight?
9. **Technology Diversity**: Should future projects intentionally diversify the technology stack beyond the patterns established in the first four projects? The SoFi retrospective suggests focusing on the right technology for the job rather than introducing new technologies for their own sake.
10. **Project Summary Format**: Should the project summaries follow a consistent format for all projects, or should they be tailored to highlight the unique aspects of each project?
11. **Communication Style**: How can we further refine the executive communication style identified in the SoFi retrospective to make project presentations more impactful?
